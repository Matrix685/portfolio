                    This website is a recreation of Google Site's "Club" default
                    layout with a few of my own design choices added in. The
                    hover effect on the "Events" page was my own creation and
                    there were a few things I didn't want to add because I
                    didn't know what to put in them or I didn't think it would
                    be worth it to recreate them.

                <p class="text">
                    I decided to recreate Google's site because I really liked
                    it's design. Looking through their features I thought some
                    of them were really cool, and that they would be fun to
                    recreate. There were a couple of things that I thought were
                    missing though, and this was another reason why I wanted to
                    remake the site from scratch.
